# PteroBot - ðŸª¶ A Discord Bot connected to your Pterodactyl API

This Discord Bot is a mission gived by `MrJuju0319#5801` to connect his Pterodactyl Panel to a Bot.

We decide to use only the Client part of the API to avoid potential big mistake like delete a server.

All commands are only usable by administrator.

## Bot Features

It can currently:
- [x] `/servers` - Show informations about all servers
- [x] `/server` - Show informations about a specific server with a selector to choose server
- [x] `/power {server_identifier} {state}` - Provide a way to change server state (start, stop, kill, restart)
- [x] `/send {server_identifier} {command}` - Send a command to a server
- [ ] `/safemode` - Stop, Kill and backups servers from lists
- [x] `/backups` - Show all backups for a server
- [x] `/create-backup` - Create a new backup for a server
- [x] `/help` - Show information about all available commands
- [ ] `/realtime {server_identifier} {channel_id}` - Associate channel command to a server and refresh regularly server informations
